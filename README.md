# SatelliteImageClassificationWithCNN
This project involves the development and testing of various models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify satellite images.

Pre-existing architectures, such as VGG16 and ResNet50, were fine-tuned and optimized for the task, along with a custom architecture developed from scratch.

Finally, an ensemble approach was employed to achieve the best-performing model.
